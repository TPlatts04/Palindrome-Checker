# Palindrome Checker Application

This is created with basic **HTML5, CSS3 and JS**.
This is a palindrome checker, a palindrome is a word or sentence which is spelled the same both backwards and forwards ignoring any spacing, puncuation and case.
The code you see was created via a request from a **freecodecamp certification project (1/5)**, i decided to copy the freecodecamps layout as i wanted to make it a replica to ensure that my knowledge
about these markup/programming languages are sufficient. It had only taken me 20mins to complete this project.
**E.g. Race Car --> Race Car**
**E.g. Yellow --> wolleY**
